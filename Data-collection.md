# A step-by-step guide to data collection

https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/data-collection/


Data collection is a systematic process of gathering observations or measurements. Whether you are performing research for business, governmental or academic purposes, data collection allows you to gain first-hand knowledge and original insights into your [research problem](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-problem/).

While methods and aims may differ between fields, the overall process of data collection remains largely the same. Before you begin collecting data, you need to consider:

* The **aim** of the research
* The **type of data** that you will collect
* The **methods and procedures** you will use to collect, store, and process the data

To collect high-quality data that is relevant to your purposes, follow these four steps.

## Step 1: Define the aim of your research

Before you start the process of data collection, you need to identify exactly what you want to achieve. You can start by writing a [problem statement](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/problem-statement/): what is the practical or scientific issue that you want to address and why does it matter?

Next, formulate one or more[ research questions](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/) that precisely define what you want to find out. Depending on your research questions, you might need to collect[ quantitative or qualitative data](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/qualitative-quantitative-research/):

* [**Quantitative data**](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/quantitative-research/) is expressed in numbers and graphs and is analyzed through [statistical methods](https://www.scribbr.com/?cat_ID=34372).
* [**Qualitative data**](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/qualitative-research/) is expressed in words and analyzed through interpretations and categorizations.

If your aim is to test a [hypothesis](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/hypotheses/), measure something precisely, or gain large-scale statistical insights, collect quantitative data. If your aim is to explore ideas, understand experiences, or gain detailed insights into a specific context, collect qualitative data. If you have several aims, you can use a [mixed methods approach](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/mixed-methods-research/) that collects both types of data.


## Step 2: Choose your data collection method

Based on the data you want to collect, decide which method is best suited for your research.

* [Experimental](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/experimental-design/) research is primarily a quantitative method.
* Interviews/focus groups and [ethnography](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/ethnography/) are qualitative methods.
* [Surveys](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/survey-research/), observations, archival research and secondary data collection can be quantitative or qualitative methods.

Carefully consider what method you will use to gather data that helps you directly answer your research questions.

| Method                    | When to use                                                                 | How to collect data                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Experiment                | To test a causal relationship.                                              | Manipulate variables and measure their effects on others.                                                                    |
| Survey                    | To understand the general characteristics or opinions of a group of people. | Distribute a list of questions to a sample online, in person or over-the-phone.                                              |
| Interview/focus group     | To gain an in-depth understanding of perceptions or opinions on a topic.    | Verbally ask participants open-ended questions in individual interviews or focus group discussions.                          |
| Observation               | To understand something in its natural setting.                             | Measure or survey a sample without trying to affect them.                                                                    |
| Ethnography               | To study the culture of a community or organization first-hand.             | Join and participate in a community and record your observations and reflections.                                            |
| Archival research         | To understand current or historical events, conditions or practices.        | Access manuscripts, documents or records from libraries, depositories or the internet.                                       |
| Secondary data collection | To analyze data from populations that you can’t access first-hand.         | Find existing datasets that have already been collected, from sources such as government agencies or research organizations. |


## Step 3: Plan your data collection procedures

When you know which method(s) you are using, you need to plan exactly how you will implement them. What procedures will you follow to make accurate observations or measurements of the [variables](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/types-of-variables/) you are interested in?

For instance, if you’re conducting surveys or interviews, decide what form the questions will take; if you’re conducting an experiment, make decisions about your [experimental design](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/experimental-design/).

### Operationalization

Sometimes your variables can be measured directly: for example, you can collect data on the average age of employees simply by asking for dates of birth. However, often you’ll be interested in collecting data on more abstract concepts or variables that can’t be directly observed.

[Operationalization](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/operationalization/) means turning abstract conceptual ideas into measurable observations. When planning how you will collect data, you need to translate the conceptual definition of what you want to study into the operational definition of what you will actually measure.

### Sampling

You may need to develop a[ sampling](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/sampling-methods/) plan to obtain data systematically. This involves defining a [population](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/population-vs-sample/), the group you want to draw conclusions about, and a sample, the group you will actually collect data from.

Your sampling method will determine how you recruit participants or obtain measurements for your study. To decide on a sampling method you will need to consider factors like the required sample size, accessibility of the sample, and timeframe of the data collection.

### Standardizing procedures

If multiple researchers are involved, write a detailed manual to standardize data collection procedures in your study.

This means laying out specific step-by-step instructions so that everyone in your research team collects data in a consistent way – for example, by conducting experiments under the same conditions and using objective criteria to record and categorize observations.

This helps ensure the [reliability](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/types-of-reliability/) of your data, and you can also use it to replicate the study in the future.

### Creating a data management plan

Before beginning data collection, you should also decide how you will organize and store your data.

* If you are collecting data from people, you will likely need to anonymize and safeguard the data to prevent leaks of sensitive information (e.g. names or identity numbers).
* If you are collecting data via interviews or pencil-and-paper formats, you will need to perform [transcriptions](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/transcribe-interview/) or data entry in systematic ways to minimize distortion.
* You can prevent loss of data by having an organization system that is routinely backed up.


## Step 4: Collect the data

Finally, you can implement your chosen methods to measure or observe the variables you are interested in.

To ensure that high quality data is recorded in a systematic way, here are some best practices:

* Record all relevant information as and when you obtain data. For example, note down whether or how lab equipment is recalibrated during an experimental study.
* Double-check manual data entry for errors.
* If you collect quantitative data, you can assess the [reliability and validity](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/reliability-vs-validity/) to get an indication of your data quality.
