# Understanding confounding variables

https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/confounding-variables/

In research that investigates a potential cause-and-effect relationship, a **confounding variable** is an unmeasured third [variable](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/types-of-variables/) that influences both the supposed cause and the supposed effect.

It’s important to consider potential confounding variables and account for them in your [research design](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/research-design/) to ensure your results are [valid](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/internal-vs-external-validity/).

## What is a confounding variable?

Confounding variables (a.k.a. confounders or confounding factors) are a type of [extraneous variable](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/extraneous-variables/) that are related to a study’s [independent and dependent variables](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/independent-and-dependent-variables/). A variable must meet two conditions to be a confounder:

* It must be [correlated](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/correlational-research/) with the independent variable. This may be a causal relationship, but it does not have to be.
* It must be causally related to the dependent variable.

## How to reduce the impact of confounding variables

There are several methods of accounting for confounding variables. You can use the following methods when studying any type of subjects—humans, animals, plants, chemicals, etc. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages.

### Restriction

In this method, you restrict your treatment group by only including subjects with the same values of potential confounding factors.

Since these values do not differ among the subjects of your study, they cannot correlate with your independent variable and thus cannot confound the cause-and-effect relationship you are studying.

* pros
  * Relatively easy to implement
* cons
  * Restricts your sample a great deal
  * You might fail to consider other potential confounders

### Matching

In this method, you select a comparison group that matches with the treatment group. Each member of the comparison group should have a counterpart in the treatment group with the same values of potential confounders, but different independent variable values.

This allows you to eliminate the possibility that differences in confounding variables cause the variation in outcomes between the treatment and comparison group. If you have accounted for any potential confounders, you can thus conclude that the difference in the independent variable must be the cause of the variation in the dependent variable.

* pros
  * Allows you to include more subjects than restriction
* cons
  * Can prove difficult to implement since you need pairs of subjects that match on every potential confounding variable
  * Other variables that you cannot match on might also be confounding variables

### Statistical control

If you have already collected the data, you can include the possible confounders as [control variables](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/control-variable/) in your [regression models](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/simple-linear-regression/); in this way, you will control for the impact of the confounding variable.

Any effect that the potential confounding variable has on the dependent variable will show up in the results of the regression and allow you to separate the impact of the independent variable.

* pros
  * Easy to implement
  * Can be performed after [data collection](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/data-collection/)
* cons
  * You can only control for variables that you observe directly, but other confounding variables you have not accounted for might remain

### Randomization

Another way to minimize the impact of confounding variables is to randomize the values of your independent variable. For instance, if some of your participants are assigned to a treatment group while others are in a [control group](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/control-group/), you can [randomly assign](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/random-assignment/) participants to each group.

Randomization ensures that with a sufficiently large sample, all potential confounding variables—even those you cannot directly observe in your study—will have the same average value between different groups. Since these variables do not differ by group assignment, they cannot correlate with your independent variable and thus cannot confound your study.

Since this method allows you to account for all potential confounding variables, which is nearly impossible to do otherwise, it is often considered to be the best way to reduce the impact of confounding variables.

* pros
  * Allows you to account for all possible confounding variables, including ones that you may not observe directly
  * Considered the best method for minimizing the impact of confounding variables
* cons
  * Most difficult to carry out
  * Must be implemented prior to beginning data collection
  * You must ensure that only those in the treatment (and not control) group receive the treatment
