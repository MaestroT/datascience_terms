# Understanding extraneous variables

https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/extraneous-variables/

In an [experiment](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/experimental-design/), an **extraneous variable** is any variable that youâ€™re not investigating that can potentially affect the outcomes of your research study.

If left uncontrolled, extraneous variables can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the relationship between[ independent and dependent variables](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/independent-and-dependent-variables/).

## Extraneous vs confounding variables

A [**confounding variable**](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/confounding-variables/) is a type of extraneous variable that is associated with both the independent and dependent variables.

* An extraneous variable is anything that could influence the dependent variable.
* A confounding variable influences the dependent variable, and **also** correlates with or causally affects the independent variable.

In a [conceptual framework](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/conceptual-framework/) diagram, you can draw an arrow from a confounder to the independent variable as well as to the dependent variable. You can draw an arrow from extraneous variables to a dependent variable.
