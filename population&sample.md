# Population vs sample: what’s the difference?

https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/population-vs-sample/

A **population** is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.

A **sample** is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population.

In research, a population doesn’t always refer to people. It can mean a group containing elements of anything you want to study, such as objects, events, organizations, countries, species, organisms, etc.

The more precisely you define your population, the easier will be to gather a representative sample![1636371535786.png](image/population&sample/1636371535786.png)


## Population parameter vs sample statistic

When you collect data from a population or a sample, there are various measurements and numbers you can calculate from the data. A [**parameter**](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/parameter-vs-statistic/) is a measure that describes the whole population. A **statistic** is a measure that describes the sample.

You can use estimation or [hypothesis testing](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/hypothesis-testing/) to estimate how likely it is that a sample statistic differs from the population parameter.

Research example: Parameters and statistics

In your study of students’ political attitudes, you ask your survey participants to rate themselves on a scale from 1, very liberal, to 7, very conservative. You find that most of your sample identifies as liberal – the mean rating on the political attitudes scale is 3.2.

You can use this  **statistic** , the sample mean of 3.2, to make a scientific guess about the **population parameter** – that is, to infer the mean political attitude rating of all undergraduate students in the Netherlands.
